# Becoming the person you want to be in the film industry

## Abstract
I'm an ambitious woman with dreams of becoming a renowned actress to fulfill my passion for cinema and make a significant impact. My journey to fame is unconventional, guided by strong values. The cinematic world is a magical kingdom, each region with unique traits. Supported by a team of data analysts, I explore cinematic data as a treasure map to my fame. While wealth is a pursuit, I'm equally motivated to promote female representation in the film industry, ensuring equal opportunities, and to create strong relationships with other actors. Exploring global film industries, from Hollywood's glamour to Europe's traditions and Asia's Bollywood, I question where to venture for wealth, success, and friends. Driven by wealth, female representation, and interconnectedness, I study global cinematic centers, understanding origins, trajectories, and unique attributes, examining productivity and historical background to uncover factors contributing to their ascension.

## Research Questions
During this quest for the ideal path to achieve my dream, my team of data analysts and I aim to answers these fondamental questions:
- What is the impact of female representation in the different film industries, and how can I contribute to promoting equal opportunities for aspiring female actors within my chosen region?
- How do wealth and success manifest in various global film industries, and which regions offer the best balance for achieving financial success while pursuing my passion for acting?
- How does the interconnectedness of actors, directors, and various components of the film industry operate across different regions, and what role does this play in the success of individuals?
- How do global historical events and cultural shifts influence the rise of cinematic centers, and what patterns can be identified in their development over time?
